<!--Fascinating-->
<!--What-->
<!--I spent a lot of time on this already.... way too much time-->
<!--So uhh.. we kinda need a way to view this website right>-->
<!--This is where GitHub Pages comes in-->
<!--So.. I think we should probably host this on your github account since it's on
your computer. So what you need to do isss. uhh. At the top where it says "view"
Click toggle "git tab"
Next click "Create Repository" and make sure it's the folder with index.html
Then uhh.. do whatever comes next. SEND ME A SCREENSHOT OF WHAT YOU'RE UP TO-->
